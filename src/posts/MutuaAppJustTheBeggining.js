            intro={<Fragment>I have so many things to share about this project and everything it implied in my life. This is my first attempt to put into words the amazing adventure that resulted from choosing to be <i> brave</i> and <i>dream huge.</i></Fragment>}

            description={<Fragment><p>Mutua App is a milestone in my life. It started as an idea that kept me awake and quickly turned into a feeling of urgency to bring a solution to a situation. Based on the complex difficulties many women in Ecuador (where I was living at the time) and Latinoamérica encounter everyday, including myself.</p>
            <p>I just couldn’t avoid it. So I decided to clear some doubts. Did exhaustive research on the sector where <i> -surprise surprise-</i> I found near to nothing.</p>
            <p>Something I couldn´t stop asking to myself and later to everyone around was: <i>Why?</i> </p>
            <p><i>Why isn’t anyone else doing what is needed to solve this problem?  Why hasn't this been done already?</i></p>
            <p>It was so crystal clear for me.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I concluded that I could give it a shot and ignited the adventure. </p>
            <p>Then -after thinking about it nonstop for days- having created a whole conceptualization of my idea in my mind, I decided it was time to test it with others, for some reality check. </p>
            <p>The first person I told about it was my sister, who not only loved the idea and understood in the blink of an eye, the major issue I wanted to tackle, but also decided to jump on board on the project. </p>
            <h2>But what is Mutua? What was Mutua anyway?</h2>
            <p>Mutua was: a product. </p>
            <p>What it still is: a concept.  </p>
            <p>Mutua is a spanish word that means <i>mutual</i>, so the whole concept is based on the possibilities and power of local communities and a fair, equitable, empathic exchange between those who have something to offer to each other.  </p>
            <p>The problem is quite simple and obvious: local transportation in Latinoamérica is inefficient on a general basis, and for women it is also dangerous.</p>
            <p>We are used to waiting for a text saying <i> -I´m home, just arrived, everything fine.- </i>from the women in our lives. That can't be the reality anymore. </p>
            <p>On the other hand we know about the fast growing situation of women who end up being <i>head of family</i>, and the difficulties of getting (and keeping) a job outside the house while also being the main caregiver at home. </p>
            <p>Mutua is placed at the sweet spot where both of these groups can help each other. Solving two different problems at the same time: </p>
            <p>Generate opportunities for women who need a safe, enjoyable and flexible source of income, while offering a really user centered quality service to women who need access to safe, inexpensive and worriless daily transportation.</p>
            <p>The way to achieve it was based on one key factor:<i> empathy.</i> Through empathy we can build engaged communities where people support each other. </p>
            <p>Imagine requesting a ride to your city centre and feeling like sitting in the front seat, next to your driver, listening to the radio, talking about life and sharing a laugh. Imagine feeling safe at all times.</p>
            <p>Why not? You can do it with Mutua. Because you can be certain that the driver has been background checked, and strongly agrees with the intention of the Mutua Community: creating a better life for women while lifting each other up.</p>
            <p>Far from being another transportation app, Mutua was based on the creation of a community of pairs where every woman could exchange not only a service, but also experiences and knowledge. With this strong intention I managed to put together a small team and within six months we had an MVP !</p>
            <p>The project had a great reception from the local community, which led to +1500 downloads for the <i>user app</i> and +300 pre-registrations of <i>future drivers </i>all within a month from launching. I was amazed, especially taking into account the ridiculously -nonexistent- marketing budget we had. </p>

            <p><i>Here are some of the messages future drivers left on the (optional) empty box within the pre-registration online form on our website</i>.</p><br></br>
            <p>Beginning in mid-2019, this whole rollercoaster lasted for 9 great months. </p>
            <p>Until when I decided it was time to stop. </p>
            <p>The concept was on point. </p>
            <p>The context was not. </p>
            <p>And luckily, I was able to see it.</p>
            <p><i>(I am going to write about what led to my decision in a coming soon article).</i></p>
            <p>In essence, this project left me with huge lessons learned and hands-on experience. It was also a tablespoon of the power of creation. How intentional socially-aware creation and hard work can grow into something amazing, really fast. </p>
            <p>There are so many problems and necessities to solve in my beloved Latinoamérica, I can’t even imagine now, dedicating my professional career to anything else. </p>
            <p>Mutua opened a door to a <i>new world</i> for me and I can't help but move forward.</p>
            <p>Finally finding purpose, for me, was complete success.</p>
            <p>I firmly believe that using <i>technology</i> to solve deeply rooted <i>social needs</i> is the most powerful tool we can count on, to create a better reality and a hopeful future. </p>
